# Summative 3 Front End

### Ensure that you have NPM and Node.js installed on your computer
To get set up, clone or download the repo, then rename the `configExample.json` file to `config.json`.

If you are going to be running this site on your own computer, your `config.json` file should look something like this:
```json
{
	"SERVER_URL": "http://localhost",
	"SERVER_PORT": "3000"
}
```
However, if you are running this project inside a virtual server, you will most likely need to change the `SERVER_URL` section to match whatever your virtual server is set to.
Once that is done, open the root folder up in terminal and type:

```sh
npm install
```

This should get you all set up for front end development.
Check out the [back end repo](https://github.com/CyborgSemon/summative-3-back) README.md to set up the server part of this project.
